# synthesizer
<pre>
A Java project to play MIDI sounds, and to play with Threads and inheritance.
(make sure to switch your computers sound 'on')
Play all sounds once, or select a sound to play.
Pitch is central C.

These are the basic, standard sounds that come with the Java MIDI package. 
Some different sounds, with different names ( like some piano versions),
sound exactly the same because they probably use the same sound wave algorithm. 

Made with Java version: openjdk version "11.0.16"
