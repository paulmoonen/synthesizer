# synthesizer
<pre>
A Java project to play MIDI sounds, and to play with Threads and inheritance.
(make sure to switch your computers sound 'on')
All sounds played once, pitch is central C.

These are the basic, standard sounds that come with the Java MIDI package. 
Some different sounds, like different piano sound names, sound exactly the same because they probably are the same. 

Made with Java version: openjdk version "11.0.16"
